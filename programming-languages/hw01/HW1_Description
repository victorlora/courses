HW01 - area, between, shorter, righttri

Please submit a Scheme text file that contains the procedures described below. Your submission should be documented as described in the Scheme coding standard; insufficiently documented submissions will be returned ungraded. 

Be sure to include sample code to demonstrate that each procedure works correctly.

circlearea

A procedure that takes the radius of a circle and returns its area. For example:

> (circlearea 3) 
28.274 
between?

A procedure that takes three arguments (a, x, & y) and returns true if a is between x and y. For example:

> (between? 4 2 7) 
#t 
> (between? 4 1 4) 
#f
> (between? 4 7 2)
#t
shorter

A procedure that returns the shorter of two list arguments. For example:

> (shorter '(a b) '(c d e)) 
(a b) 
> (shorter '(a b) '(c d)) 
(a b) 
> (shorter '(a b) '(c)) 
(c) 
Hint: the procedure length returns the length of its argument.

righttri?

A procedure that takes a list of three numbers and returns true if the square of the largest number equals the sum of the squares of the two smaller numbers. For example:

> (righttri? '(2 4 3)) 
#f 
> (righttri? '(5 3 4)) 
#t
