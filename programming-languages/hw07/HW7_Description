Rewrite the 3 environment ADT implementations (procedural, datatype, and ribcage) so that instead of using a list of symbols and a list of values, they use a list of symbol-value pairs. So the environment might be created by code like either of the following lines (you can choose which one).

(define env1 (extend-env '(c 3) '(d 4) (extend-env '(a 1) '(b 2) (empty-env))))
(define env1 (extend-env '((c 3) (d 4)) (extend-env '((a 1) (b 2)) (empty-env))))
