HW12 - Description

Extend interp3.9.scm (available from Moodle) to include the following capabilities:

(Exercise 3.63, pg 121) do-while, which is like while except that the test is performed after the execution of the body.
(Exercise 3.64, pg 122) allow variables in block statements to be initialized.
Your submission should be documented as described in the Scheme coding standard; insufficiently documented submissions will be returned ungraded. Be sure to include sample code to demonstrate that everything works correctly.

Examples

; do-while containing compound-stmt
var x; { x = 2; do { x = sub1(x); print(x) } while x }

; block variable initialization, followed by compound-stmt
var x = 3, y = 4; { x = 5; print(+(x,y))}
