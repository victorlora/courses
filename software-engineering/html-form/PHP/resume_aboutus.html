<p>Our goal is to make the process of creating a resume into a easy task. In order to ensure this goal, we had to think of all needed descriptions to add to the resume to make it thorough.  <br> This will allow for students from college or anyone applying to a job, to have the ability to create a professional resume by simply filling in text boxes with their personalized information. <br> We created this website as an assignment for Software Engineering with the use of HTML, CSS, and PHP to allow for a seamless experience while using the website. <br> Our website is based out of Muhlenberg College, but any college student from around the world has the ability to create their own resume with the use of this website. <br> We wanted to take a task that is known to be a challenge to some, and wanted to make it possible for all. <br> Our website also allows the user to have a finalized, printable version of their resume, straight from the website without the need of having to download the document. </p>
