<h1>Muhlenberg College Resident Housing</h1>

<h2>College Resident Halls</h2>

Living on campus at Muhlenberg affords you many opportunities and has proven
 to be instrumental in the academic success of Muhlenberg students. As an 
 on-campus resident, you will have ample opportunity to grow and develop 
 outside the classroom as you live with people who understand the educational
 process and can discuss classes, professors, homework, and exams with you. 
 Living on campus enhances your overall education and is perhaps one of the
 best ways to develop friendships with peers that will be cherished for a
 lifetime. Great opportunities await as you embark on your college career.
 At Muhlenberg, we have 8 residence halls offering a variety of attractive
 and complete housing and dining packages. The residence halls house 35
 to 215 occupants. Furniture, expanded basic FM-TV cable service plus
 one premium channel, basic telephone service, utilities, and 
 coin-operated laundry facilities are also provided. New and 
 renovated residence halls have card swipe for entrance 
 and laundry facilities. 

In addition, many halls have their own pool table, piano, or ping-pong 
table. For mobility impaired students, all residence halls have limited access
 to the first-floor common areas. All residence halls are also smoke free.

<h3>INTERNET</h3>

BergWiFi is available for all students in the residence halls.

<h3>CHECKOUTS</h3>

To expedite your residence hall check out process, please sign up for a check
out time with an RA. This will need to be a prearranged check out time. This 
will help eliminate additional fees and our ability to assist you as you
 depart residential life. We have an exit survey we will ask you to fill 
 out as well so we get to know your reasons for leaving.
 
<h3>TELEPHONE</h3>

Current students, remember, if you have a voice mail account, please cancel
 your account with Verizon prior to checking out of the residence halls.
